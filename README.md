# Coupling Experimentation and Simulation for building the Network Digital Twin of an IoT Network
This code corresponds to the two contributions described in the following preprint paper (please cite this in case you use the code):

```
@article{si2024ns-ndt,
  title={NS+NDT: Smart Integration of Network Simulation in Network Digital Twin, Application to IoT Networks},
  author={Si-Mohammed, Samir and Bardou, Anthony and Begin, Thomas and Lassous, Isabelle Gu{\'e}rin and Vicat-Blanc, Pascale},
  journal={Future Generation Computer Systems},
  year={2024},
  publisher={Elsevier}
}
```

The code is divided into two main parts: The 'config-optimization' folder which contains the code corresponding to the COSIMIA method and the 'energy-calibration' folder which contains the code for calibrating energy consumption models of ns-3 using real measurements taken from the FIT IoT-Lab platform.
